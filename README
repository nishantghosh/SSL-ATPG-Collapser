The directory structure is as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
./collapse.py  - The source code for the project.

./bench        - ISCAS circuits as well as correct benchmark program outputs.

./logs         - Logs created during execution are placed here by default.
	         The collapse.py as provided automatically creates a log
		 file when run.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note that the program will create two output files by default,
"temp.fclass" and "temp.order". The location (and name) of these files is
controlled by the last argument provided when invoking the program.

Documentation for the cframe module can currently be found in:

	1. https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~bniewe/python_cframe/_modules/cframe.html#Circuit
	   (Courtesy of Benjamin Niewenhuis) 
	2. Invoking the help() function in an interactive python shell:
	   (765py) prompt> python
	   >>> import cframe
	   >>> help(cframe.Circuit)

More documentation (likely in html form) will be made available as soon as
it is completed (look for a course announcement).
